> Hi! This is a multiplayer marvel game project for our CS course! This game is implemented using Java.

## Game Rules
**Each player will select his three champions to form his team. The champions will take turns based on their speed. The champion with the highest speed (from  all selected champions) will begin acting first followed by the champion with the second highest speed an so on. When the turn goes to a champion, the player controlling the champion can use him to carry out any action as long as the champion has enough action points needed for this action and also has enough mana in case of using any of his abilities. After that, the champion can end his turn and the turn will go to the next champion.**

**The turns will keep passing over the living champions till a player is able to defeat all the of the three champions of the opponent player. In this case, the game ends and the player with the living champions will be declared the winner.**
